# Gotg RDF Tutorial
An example of how to store descriptive information about fictional marvel comic book characters using the markup language XML. Includes an original RDF document describing the 4 Classes and 16 Properties belonging to 7 central characters from the Guardians of the Galaxy (GOTG) along with origin/background details that fans of the movies may not have known about their favorite characters. There's also an RDF Schema file along with Powerpoint slides showcasing validated Triples and an image of the resulting Graph Model as displayed on the W3C Validation Service website (https://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/).
